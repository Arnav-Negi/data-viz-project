                The visualisation created to show the trends and patterns in deaths
                caused by conflict and terrorism in different countries over a period
                of time. By using a bar chart race format, the viewer can see how
                the ranking and magnitude of deaths have changed over time for
                different countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The visualisation is using a bar chart race format,
                where the bars representing the number of deaths for
                each country move and change size over time.
                The top 12 countries by deaths are shown in the race,
                and the bars are labeled with the country name and number
                of deaths for each year.
