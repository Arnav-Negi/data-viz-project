                                    deaths.

                                    of deaths recorded for each cause, with the largest circles indicating the highest
                                    numbers of deaths. This method allows for a quick and easy comparison of the
                                    relative
                                    number of deaths for each cause.

                                        bottom of the visualization makes it easy to navigate through the different years
                                        and understand the changes that have occurred over time. Hovering over a specific
                                        country highlights its borders and displays a tooltip that contains
                                        relevant information about the country, such as its name and the number of
                                        smoking-related deaths that occurred in the year that the slider is on. The
                                        interactivity of the visualization makes it easier for users to explore and gain
                                        insights into the data.
