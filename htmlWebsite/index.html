                            Our project revolves around the various causes of death and the burden of diseases across
                            the world and the shift of the same over time. We have used various datasets to visualize
                            this and have involved the use of several types of charts and graphs to bring out the
                            important details of the data.

                                the
                                burden of disease faced by humans globally. It shows the number of deaths from

                                causes over a 30-year period in a visually appealing way that makes it easier for

                                The visualization displays the total number of deaths recorded in the world for
                                specific
                                causes between 1990 and 2019. It provides a visual representation of the number of
                                deaths as the area of circles, with larger circles indicating higher numbers of
                                deaths.

                                The visualization uses a circle-packing technique, which arranges circles within a
                                container so that they do not overlap. The circles are sized according to the number
                                of deaths recorded for each cause, with the largest circles indicating the highest
                                numbers of deaths. This method allows for a quick and easy comparison of the
                                relative
                                number of deaths for each cause.

                                healthcare expenditure, GDP per capita, and death rates. By plotting the data points
                                on a scatter plot, we can see if there is any correlation between these variables.

                                size of the dots. By looking at the plot, we can see the relationship between these
                                three variables for different countries over time.

                                each country over a 20-year period. The size of the dots represents the death rates
                                of the country. The coordinates are used to color the points, creating clusters

                                    The visualization is using a world map to display the number of smoking-related
                                    deaths per 100,000 people. The color-coding of the countries also helps to
                                    quickly differentiate between the countries that have a higher number of
                                    smoking-related deaths and those that have a lower number. The slider at the

                                    and understand the changes that have occurred over time. Hovering over a specific
                                    country highlights its borders and displays a tooltip that contains
                                    relevant information about the country, such as its name and the number of
                                    smoking-related deaths that occurred in the year that the slider is on. The

                    <h2>What is Burden of Disease?</h2>
                    <p>The sum of mortality and morbidity is referred to as the ‘burden of disease’ and can be measured
                        by a metric called ‘Disability Adjusted Life Years‘ (DALYs). DALYs are measuring lost health and
                        are a standardized metric that allow for direct comparisons of disease burdens of different
                        diseases across countries, between different populations, and over time. Conceptually, one DALY
                        is the equivalent of losing one year in good health because of either premature death or disease
                        or disability. One DALY represents one lost year of healthy life.</p>

                            The visualisation is displaying the number of deaths due to conflict and terrorism for
                            multiple countries from 1990 to 2019 in a bar chart race format. It shows the viewer how the

                            The visualisation is using a bar chart race format, where the bars representing the number
                            of deaths for each country move and change size over time. The top 12 countries by deaths
                            are shown in the race, and the bars are labeled with the country name and number of deaths
                            for each year. The animation and interactivity of the bar chart race allow the viewer to see
                            the changes and patterns in the data over time.

                            A bar chart race is a very fun and interactive way to display data over time.
                            It is used in many entertainment use cases such as documentaries and news to show change in
                            some
                            quantity over time, such as stock prices, company evaluations, etc. It is also a convenient
                            way of showing a lot of
                            data in a small screen, with the use of time as the 3rd dimension.

                            It is visualizing the amount of DALY lost over time for different age groups. The age
                            groups are categorized into 70+ years, 50-69, 15-49, 5-14, and under 5. The stacked area
                            chart displays the trends in each age group's DALYs, which can be compared with one
                            another. By choosing a specific country from the input, the user can see the trend in
                            DALYs for different age groups for that country.

                            The visualization is a stacked area chart that displays the trend in DALY lost for
                            different age groups over time. The x-axis represents the year, while the y-axis
                            represents the amount of DALY lost. Each age group is represented by a different color,
                            and the stacked area chart shows how much DALY is lost for each age group in each year.
                            The input allows the user to choose a specific country to observe the trend in DALY for
                            different age groups in that country. The chart is useful in highlighting trends and
                            patterns in health outcomes, especially for children in the under 5 and 5-14 age groups.

                            The stacked area chart is a useful way of showing data stratified into many layers.
                            It is useful for showing the distribution of a quantity over time, and how the various
                            layers evolve with respect to the total.
                            The graph also has a select option that can be used to compare the age based mortalities of
                            different countries.

                            The indexed line chart shows the change in self harm deaths (suicides) in different
                            countries over time. The y-axis represents the number of deaths and is scaled

                            mouse. Each line represents a different country.

                            The visualisation uses an indexed line chart to display the change in self harm deaths
                            (suicides) in different countries over time. The chart has a logarithmic y-axis, which helps
                            to better visualise the change in countries with a large range of suicide rates. The cursor
                            moves along with the user's mouse, and the chart updates in real-time to show the change in
                            each country's suicide rate.

                            The indexed line chart is a useful way of finding how a data changes over time with respect
                            to the
                            current value. The y scale is a log scale, hence the viewer can easily see whether it stayed
                            the same,
                            doubled, halved, etc. Moreover, since the mark here is a line, several countries can be
                            shown together
                            on the same chart, making it easier to compare.
